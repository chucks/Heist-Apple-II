# About Heist-Apple-II

This repo contains 6502 assembler source for parts of a game called Heist, developed in 1983-1984 by Darin Young, Dennis Henry, and Chuck Shnider.

Only 2 of 4 levels of the game were ever developed.

Right now, just the assembler source is included, but if I can figure out a way to transfer the BASIC source files to text, I'll include them as well.
